My Corner: DNWR and ZLB
=======================

I want to expand (ever so slightly) on the work of Daly and Hobijn (2013) by exploring the interaction of DNWR and the ZLB.

As Daly and Hobijn and Benigno and Ricci (2011) emphasize, we can get costs from DNWR by subjecting agents *idiosyncratic* shocks to disutility from labor (possibly productivity as well?) .  I need to check more closely, but a cursory glance of Coibion et al.'s treatment of the issue ignores this.  Presumably Kim and Ruge-Murica's findings are also affected by this omission.

CartHorse
---------

Two issues immediately come to light.  First, what are these DNWRs?  I'm tempted to take them as given for now.  Explaining what they are is outside of my interest for this project.  Still, an explanation should be in hand, albeit abound with caveats.  Second, those idiosyncratic labor shocks.  How to interpret?  Are they there in the data?  Are they worthy building a model around?

The question now is which framework to adopt.  Daly and Hobijn simplify in a quest for tractability and transition dynamics.  The others are searching more for realism.

Data Gathering
--------------

Using CPS data from the [Census Bureau](http://thedataweb.rm.census.gov/ftp/cps_ftp.html) and the [NBER](http://www.nber.org/data/current-population-survey-data.html).

Going to validate possibly agains [IPUMS](https://cps.ipums.org/cps/).

Start at a Proposal
===================

What are the effects of downward nominal wage rigidities at the zero lower bound?  On optimal monetary policy, on the labor market, on output? And also what are the effects of the zero lower bound on downward nominal wage rigidities?  THe evidence gets a bit thin here unless we go cross country.

Some prior research (Coibon et. al) have found that ZLB events don't matter all that much when it comes to optimal monetary policy.  They just don't occur frequently enough.  And when DNWR is added as a fraction welfare actually improves via lower volatility of output.

This paper at least (and likely others) do not include idiosyncratic shocks to labor disutility.  Daly and Hobijn get results by including this; they argue hetorogenous shocks are necessary to have DNWR impart a meaningful effect on employment.  What are these idiosyncratic shocks?  We probably don't want to take them literally.  But do they have any meaning?  I'd hate hate hate to have something so tenuous as a necessary condition for the *raison d'Ãªtre* of my paper.
