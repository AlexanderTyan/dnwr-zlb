Notes on the ''High'' Inflation of the Great Recession
======================================================

Starting from the observation that inflation has been higher than we'd expect given the large output gap.

Potential Explanations
-------------------------

* Downward Nominal Wage Rigidity
* Fed Policies

  * Communication
  * QE
  * Just more stable anchoring in general

* Transitory/Nonspecific effects
  
  * Commodity prices?
  * Exchange rate effects?

Goal
-------

Model the evolution of inflation and output (employment) in a setting that allows for (at least) downward nominal wage rigidity (DNWR) and unconventional monetary policy (good luck).

Assume said model and run counterfactuals.  How do inflation and output co-move when we shut down one or more of the above effects?

Compare with Great Depression, Japan, Europe today?

Foreseen Difficulties
---------------------

* DNWR -> ZLB -> log-linearization bad?

Research Path
-------------

* Find a framework
