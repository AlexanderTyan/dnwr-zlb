## Motivation

Motivation for my second year paper, not for this topic necessarily.

Interested in inflation in recessions, leads to wage rigidities fairly quickly.

Wage rigidity research is emphasizing the importance of idiosyncratic shocks.

Hadn't been introduced to the optimal inflation literature.

## Evidence for?

Pretty well accepted.

## Model Overview

With that setup, answer questions like what's a good policy,
possibility of ZLB, how do idiosyncratic shocks affect inflation predictions.

## Production

Not much here.  Standard Dixit-Stigliz stuff.

## Household

Share consumption.

Idiosyncratic shock to labor preference.

Calvoesque DNWR.

## Wage Setting: Flexible

Lognormality gives nice solution


## Wage Setting: Rigid

*Individual* maximizes his own terms.

Possibly restricted to increased wage.

First line is the **Wage Schedule**.  Look at limiting case.

## Wage Setting Compared

Two comparisons to make:

Optimal wage as a function of the shock, if you're free to choose.

* Rigidities lower optimal wage
* Inflation undoes some of that rigidity

## Results: Wage Change Distribution

No rigidities would be normal.

Highlights

* Asymmetric
* Spike at 0

## Output: Flexible

Lognormality gives nice solution

## Output Rigid

Not that bad.  3 groups

* Free to choose
* Restricted, but increasing wage anyway
* Restricted, would like to lower but can't


## Results: Output?

* A bit odd
* A bit different

## End
