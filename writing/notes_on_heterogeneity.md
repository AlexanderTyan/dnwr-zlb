Notes on Heterogeneity
======================


Just trying to organize my thoughts here.

So Coibion et. al. don't have any heterogenity. To solve for optimal inflation they use a quadratic approximation welfare under various inflation levels, a la Woodford (2003).

Lee (2010) looks like a plausible route to handling this.

### My Work

This is *just* a Taylor expansion.  
You're adding in a third argument to the utility function u(C, Z(i), xi).

The higher order effects shouldn't matter since v_ZZ = 0.

I think this is all OK.

With log utility sigma = 1, and g\_t = xi_t

See Woodford (2003) Prop 6.12 p. 444.
