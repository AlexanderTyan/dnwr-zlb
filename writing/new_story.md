Inequality
==========

An alluring topic, I'll admit.  But my initial enthusiasm has waned.

What do we know abuot inequality?  First be careful to distinguish among income, consumption and wealth inequality.  In my context I suppose we'd be talking about income for the most part, and consumption to a lesser extent.  The issue with consumption inequality and DNWR is that any effects at the lower end of the income distribution (where DNWR should be more prevalent?) might be polluted by ephemeral things like public transfers.  It might not shed much light on the DNWR side of things.

With respect to income inequality, look at changes of different quantiles?

Worries:

* If the story is in all or mostly in the high incomes, what does DNWR have to say?
* 

New Story
=========

I'm trying to come up with a story / framework more interesting than "workers post wage, work however many hours as demanded at that wage."

### Monopsony and Matching

Somewhat based off of Robin (2011), what if:

* Firms have monopsony power => hire at workers reservation wage $w^*$.  All the surplus $S$ goes to the firm.
* Suddenly a recession appears! Workers faced with the choice of:

    1. Accept wage cut (to new, lower, recession reservation wage $w_r^*$?)
    2. Refuse wage cut, surplus is negative, firm goes under, worker thrown into bad labor market.

With those "choices", why don't firms immediatly just renegotiate to that new, lower wage, again sucking up the surplus? Productivity loss?  Workers *possibly* refuse?  I need some way to generate a margin. hurf.

#### Missing Pieces

* On the job search?
